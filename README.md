# Color Blocks

##### Introduction
In [Dev Bootcamp] I was assigned a task to create anything in order to explore a new technology. I utilized [Colour Lover's] API to make a request for a set of random colors. Since the API only sends XML for a random color set, I used Nokogiri to extract only the hex values. An AJAX call was used to retrieve these values and then used to color the blocks. 

I wanted eight blocks (because why not?) so two API requests are sent. I then used CSS transition property to create a fun color changing effect. [Draggable UI] was also installed to create a fun dragging effect. It was then deployed to Heroku.
